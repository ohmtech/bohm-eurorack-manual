# Functional Test Mode

Should you have a problem with the modules, our support team will ask you to run "test mode" to have a rough idea of what the problem is.
This mode is also the mode used in factory to functionally test and calibrate the
modules before they are delivered to you.

This operation requires a bit of care because you will need to access the back
of your module while turning the module on, in order to access test mode.

As for equipement, you will need:

- A simple LFO and VCO
- A stable 3V voltage source such as one coming from a Volt/Octave device (an external or Eurorack device, such as the Arturia Beatstep Pro or Intellijel ÂµMIDI or equivalent will do)


## Entering Test Mode

To enter test mode:

1. **Turn off** your Eurorack system
1. **Remove all the Eurorack patch cables** connected to the module
1. Remove the module from the rack, but **keep its power cord attached**
1. **Press** the {guilabel}`FLASH_SW` button at the top, between the two printed circuit boards of the module, **keep it pressed**, and **turn on** your Eurorack system. The test mode welcome screen will appear
1. Press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`, the screen will turn entirely white. Check that the screen is working properly, and press {guilabel}`FUNCTION` again

The screen will show something similar to:
```
DETECTED
BOHM
GROOVE
PERFORMER
```

Make sure that all your expanders appear in that list. Then:

- To only test the expanders, click the {guilabel}`FUNCTION` button
- To test all the modules, press the {guilabel}`FUNCTION` button for at least 1 second

## Testing Expanders

If the Groove expander is present:

1. Check that the {guilabel}`CLOCK` LED is blinking, press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Turn the {guilabel}`2` knob fully on the left, then fully on the right, then press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Repeat the previous step for the {guilabel}`3`, {guilabel}`4`, {guilabel}`LENGTH`, {guilabel}`PITCH`, {guilabel}`FX`, {guilabel}`COLOR` knobs, {guilabel}`VOL` slider, and then for the {guilabel}`FX`, and {guilabel}`COLOR` attenuverter trims
1. Acknowledge that you have already removed all patch cables and press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Wait until the module calibrates CVs automatically
1. Use your LFO in sinus mode and connect it to the {guilabel}`FX` CV
1. Repeat the previous step for {guilabel}`CLOCK`, {guilabel}`COLOR`, {guilabel}`VOL`, {guilabel}`LENGTH`, {guilabel}`PITCH`, and {guilabel}`TAP` CVs
1. Connect a cable between the {guilabel}`TAPS` CV output and {guilabel}`TAPS` CV input, then press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`

If the Performer expander is present:

1. Press the {guilabel}`ON/OFF` button
1. Check that the {guilabel}`ON/OFF` LED is blinking, press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Turn the {guilabel}`DUCK` knob fully on the left, then fully on the right, then press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Repeat the previous step for the {guilabel}`FX` knobs and {guilabel}`VOL` slider
1. Acknowledge that you have already removed all patch cables and press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Wait until the module calibrates CVs automatically
1. Use your LFO in sinus mode and connect it to the {guilabel}`DUCK` CV
1. Repeat the previous step for {guilabel}`FX`, {guilabel}`ON/OFF` and {guilabel}`VOL` CVs
1. Use your VCO in sinus mode and **connect it to the right input {guilabel}`IN` first**
1. Repeat the previous step with the left input {guilabel}`IN`

After the expanders have been calibrated, `CALIBRATION SAVED` will appear
on the screen. Clicking the {guilabel}`FUNCTION` will show the "QC passed" stamp,
which means that your module is in specs (no problem were found) and calibration is complete.

You can now turn off your Eurorack system, and reinstall the module into your rack.

## Testing All Modules

It is completely similar to the expanders test, except the central
Bohm module will be also tested and calibrated. For this reason you will need,
on top of the LFO/VCO requirements for the expanders, a stable 3V voltage source.

Typically, you will want to use a Eurorack sequencer, or a MIDI to CV module.

If you are only testing the module and don't have a stable 3V voltage source, you can
turn off your Eurorack system before reaching the `CALIBRATION SAVED` step
mentioned in the previous section.

1. Press the {guilabel}`HIT` button
1. Check that the {guilabel}`HIT` LED is blinking, press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Make sure a SD card is in the microSD card slot and press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Read the SD card test status and press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Turn {guilabel}`FUNCTION` 10 times on the left, then 10 times on the right
1. Turn the {guilabel}`LENGTH` knob fully on the left, then fully on the right, then press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Repeat the previous step for the {guilabel}`SUSTAIN`, {guilabel}`ATTACK`, {guilabel}`PITCH`, {guilabel}`CURVE`, {guilabel}`TRS DECAY`, {guilabel}`COLOR`, {guilabel}`FX`, {guilabel}`TRS TONE` knobs, and then for the {guilabel}`LENGTH`, {guilabel}`SUSTAIN`, {guilabel}`PITCH` and {guilabel}`COLOR` attenuverter trims
1. Acknowledge that you have already removed all patch cables and press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Wait until the module calibrates CVs automatically
1. Use your LFO in sinus mode and connect it to the {guilabel}`LENGTH` CV
1. Repeat the previous step for {guilabel}`ATTACK`, {guilabel}`SUSTAIN`, {guilabel}`HIT`, {guilabel}`PITCH`, {guilabel}`CURVE`, {guilabel}`COLOR`, {guilabel}`TRS DECAY`, {guilabel}`TONE`, {guilabel}`FUNCTION`, {guilabel}`VELOCITY` and {guilabel}`FX` CVs
1. Connect a cable between your stable 3 Volts source and {guilabel}`PITCH` CV input, then press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Wait until the module calibrates the {guilabel}`PITCH` CV automatically
1. Connect a patch cable from {guilabel}`OUT` left to your audio output and make sure a 440Hz tone is playing, press {guilabel}`FUNCTION`
1. Repeat the previous step with {guilabel}`OUT` right

The test mode and calibration will then follow with the present expanders if any.
For more details, follow the instruction in the previous section.
