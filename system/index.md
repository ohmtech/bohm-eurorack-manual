# System Settings

The system settings are accessed by pressing the {guilabel}`FUNCTION` button
for at least 2 seconds.

## Pitch CV option

By default, the {guilabel}`PITCH` CV is not tracking musical pitch and the entire kick octave
can be CV controlled using for example a LFO with a Â±5V output range.

Bohm can pitch track the kick octave using Volt/Octave. This options then allows
to select the 1V voltage range to map to the octave, either 0..1V, 1..2V or 2..3V.


## ATTVERT 2 option

By default, the {guilabel}`SUSTAIN` attenuverter is mapped to the {guilabel}`SUSTAIN` CV.
It is however possible to map it instead to the {guilabel}`VELOCITY` CV.


## Func Rand option

By default, the {guilabel}`FUNCTION` trigger in Studio mode will randomize only
the Bohm and Groove (_ie._ not the performer). It is possible to randomize
everything using this option:

- `ALL`: Randomize Bohm, Groove and Performer
- `B+G`: Randomize only Bohm and Groove


## Perf FX option

By default, activating or deactivating the Performer FX section is synced to
{guilabel}`HIT`. It is also possible to toggle it immediately:

- `INSTANT`: Toggle FX section immediately
- `SYNCED`: Sync FX to next {guilabel}`HIT`


## Scrn Saver option

By default, the screen saver option is `ON`, as it is important to maximize the
lifetime of your Bohm OLED screen. However in some situations it might
undesirable, for example when shooting a video or during a live
performance.
The screen saver can therefore be turned `OFF` to accomodate those cases.


## Shop Mode option

By default, the module will remember the last model used, as well as all variations
settings of the last 12 models used.

By turning on the Shop Mode option, one can prevent that, allowing a shop owner
to reset the module in the same condition for customers to have the same
initial experience with the module.
